# This file contains default .gitignore rules. To use it, copy it to .gitignore,
# and it will cause files like your settings.php and user-uploaded files to be
# excluded from Git version control. This is a common strategy to avoid
# accidentally including private information in public repositories and patch
# files.
#
# Because .gitignore can be specific to your site, this file has a different
# name; updating Drupal core will not override your custom .gitignore file.

# Ignore directories generated by Composer.

# Ignore configuration files that may contain sensitive information.

# Ignore SimpleTest multi-site environment.

# If you prefer to store your .gitignore file in the htdocs/sites/ folder, comment
# or delete the previous settings and uncomment the following ones, instead.
